# V2MIDI: Hear Your Art 🎨🎵

Welcome to V2MIDI, an innovative project at the intersection of visual art, music generation, and artificial intelligence. V2MIDI aims to synchronize visual art and music, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven creativity.

## 🌟 Project Overview

V2MIDI is a comprehensive system that transforms visual content into synchronized MIDI music. It consists of three main components:

1. **MIDIvideo Dataset**: A novel dataset pairing MIDI files with AI-generated synchronized videos.
2. **Binary Classification Model**: Our initial proof-of-concept for audio-visual synchronization.
3. **Multilabel Classification Model**: The current, more sophisticated approach for detailed rhythm detection.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `MIDIvideo_dataset/`: Tools and examples for creating our unique audio-visual dataset.
- `V2MIDI_binary/`: Implementation of the binary classification model.
- `V2MIDI_multilabel/`: Code for the advanced multilabel classification approach.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **MIDIvideo Dataset Creation**: Convert MIDI to visual configurations and generate synchronized videos.
- **AI-Powered Synchronization**: Utilize deep learning to detect rhythmic patterns in visual input.
- **MIDI Reconstruction**: Generate MIDI files from video content, bridging visual and auditory art.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for both personal computers and supercomputing environments.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Explore the `MIDIvideo_dataset/` to understand our unique dataset creation process.
2. Check out `V2MIDI_binary/` for our initial approach and proof-of-concept.
3. Dive into `V2MIDI_multilabel/` for the current state-of-the-art model and inference capabilities.

Each folder contains detailed README files with specific instructions and requirements.

## 🌈 Potential Applications

- Enhancing live musical performances with synchronized visuals
- Creating interactive, AI-driven art installations
- Assisting in music video production and visual album creation
- Developing new tools for music composition and visual art creation

## 🔬 Ongoing Research

V2MIDI is an active research project. We're continuously refining our models, exploring new applications, and pushing the boundaries of AI in creative expression. Stay tuned for regular updates, new results, and exciting developments!
